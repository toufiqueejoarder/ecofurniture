In today's fast-changing business environment, it's extremely important to be
able to respond to client needs in the most effective and timely manner. In most
cases customers wish to see the business online and have instant access to the
products or services. Eco Furniture is a furniture-based e-commerce web
application, which retails various types of furniture. This project allows  
viewers to view available products, enable user registration, purchase desired
products. This project provides an easy access to Administrators to view orders
and edit inventories. In order to develop an e-commerce website, a number of
technologies must be studied and understood. These using CSS, PHP, Bootstrap and
JavaScript. This is a project with the objective to develop a basic website
where a consumer is provided with a shopping cart application and also to know
about the technologies used to develop such an application. This document will
discuss each of the underlying technologies to create and implement an ecommerce
website.

**Introduction and Background:**
============================

Talking about the project, it has all the essential features required for an
e-commerce website. This project contains the user and admin side. Admin can
manage products, view orders and many more. From user account, he/she can view
products and purchase it easily. The Admin plays the main role in the management
of the website. In this project, admin performs all the main functions like
managing products, users and much more.

After logging in as a user, he/she can view all the available products and gets
access to add the product in their carts to purchase. Each and every product
contains its own photo, descriptions with reasonable price. In order to purchase
an item, the user has to enter product quantity, dimensions and complete
shipping address. There are different product categories too. This e-commerce
website lists all products in userâ€™s feed with its respective price. Without
logging in as a user, he/she wonâ€™t get any access to purchase any items; only
the user can check items and its details.

Objectives:
===========

The objectives of this project:

1.  User login & sign up

2.  Administrator Dashboard

3.  Carts

4.  User and admin logs information

5.  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) products

6.  Add users

Scope:
======

Following tasks will be undertaken as a part of the proposed research

a) Visual models of furniture with respective details to make the purchase
easier. There will be an image will every listed product and user can see all
available options with it.

b) Customizable designs. It will guide the user to find the right sized
furniture for their home, user will be able to choose a different approach than
the existing models.

c) Calculating the existing model and specific custom model and provide a
suitable price for the furniture.

d) We may add 3D models in the product to make the furniture more realistic.

Methodology and Approach:
=========================

Most of the online furniture shop lacks the visual representation option for the
clients. For home and office usage this project will be a problem solver when
needed.

The product will have a varieties of furniture model in it. In the description
menu all of the details will be given regarding that specific model. The user
might want a different sized or a little bit different model comparing with
their house model, for that case the request will be handled by an admin for
their desired furniture. This will make the purchase much easier and
comfortable.

Software Used:
==============

XAMPP will be used a virtual server and all other necessary software for running
CSS, PHP. Bootstrap and JavaScript.
